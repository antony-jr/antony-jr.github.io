Except for FreeCAD.","tag":"Personal","imageProvided":true,"imageCopyright":"Twitter","read":5},"date":"Sun Jan 24 2021","markdownBody":"\n**Four years** ago I started working on a simple C++ library called **\"AppImage Updater Bridge**. This project was a alternative\nto the **AppImage Update** library made by the AppImage folks. The upstream project used a lot of legacy code and was tailored for\nmore vanilla C++ folks and was sort of like a reference implementation. Also they lacked good documentation. But I can't blame\nthe upstream because they are more focused on the core functionality of AppImages.\n\nMy new C++ library was geared towards the **Qt folks**. The goal was to make a Qt plugin which can do the update mechanism with \nless legacy code and make full use of the Qt framework. The software was made to work as a standalone library and a plugin to be \nused with [**Update Deploy Qt**](https://github.com/antony-jr/updatedeployqt).\n\nMy main end goal for this piece of software is to use it with [**Update Deploy Qt**](https://github.com/antony-jr/updatedeployqt) which can\ngive any Qt based Application a nice updater with zero code change and this is programming language independent. This idea was very old \nbut still I'm lazy to execute this idea ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…\n\n**In the past I've tried to ask some Qt folks to try this project if they thought about giving their application which is packaged as \nAppImage a nice updater.**\n\nThe first person to adopt is [technic93](https://gitlab.com/technic93)(I have no idea about his real name). He is the author and maintainer \nof [e2designer](https://gitlab.com/technic93/e2designer) which is a **\"Skin editor for enigma2\"** (I have no idea about enigma2 ðŸ˜†). Go checkout \nhis/her project or his/her other works.\n\nThere was lot of people, only small open source projects were ready to adopt this. Some say **Open Source is like business**, I think that a lot\nof developers think that way that's why when a open source project gets huge they are very picky and would wish for stability over cutting edge.\n\nOne such software might be **qTox**, It's a chatting application which is secure. They actually used my library for like 2 weeks, Then they \njust said it lacks **more eyes on the project**(Hmm... in a word stars) so they reverted my changes. And this actually took significant work \nto implement in their application. But I never minded because my end goal was not make the qTox folks use it anyway. I just wanted more users\non board to see if I really did a good job.\n\n**Now let's come to FreeCAD.**\n\nQuoting from Wikipedia, *\"FreeCAD is a free and open-source (under the LGPLv2+ license) general-purpose parametric 3D computer-aided design (CAD) modeler and a building information modeling (BIM) software with finite element method (FEM) support\"*.\n\nSo you get the idea. In simple words it's a 3D modeler and open source alternative for other Computer Aided Design softwares which costs a lot.\n\nRecently I've talked to some FreeCAD users and developers. They all seem like nice folks. The community is huge and diverse that they don't put\nall the work on a single person like what some open source projects do.\n\nThe author of the AppImage project itself opened a issue on FreeCAD for a self-update from FreeCAD itself. See this [issue](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-AppImage/issues/27) for the entire conversation.\nOne user with the handle [luzpaz](https://github.com/luzpaz) also insisted FreeCAD.\n\nFinally everything was in place because of [Lorenz Lechner](https://looooo.github.io/mini-blog/), one of the core contributors to FreeCAD who helped to setup everything and make a alpha release.\n\nI was actually not expecting much response from this improvement because you know there is the official update tools and stuff so why would anyone \nuse the inbuilt updater.\n\nBut I was wrong because **FreeCAD is a unusual popular open source project because they listen to every single member of the community.** \nAnd they are not very picky like other popular projects. They are simple.\n\n\nAnd on October 14th 2020 they tweeted about this new feature,\n\n```tweet\n1316351710609235972\n```\n\nI hope every popular open source project listen to the community and not just force something to them. **Forcing something in open source is not \nreally good. Firefox does it and Gnome does it. They are the fastest way to kill a project.**\n\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this post.\n","slug":"2021-01-24","prevPost":{"title":"ðŸ¥³ My first patch got accepted into the Linux Kernel ðŸ¥³","slugName":"2020-12-27","date":"Sun Dec 27 2020"},"nextPost":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/post/[slug]","query":{"slug":"2021-01-24"},"buildId":"U-O5WQXHlmPlqtRIwPfQt","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"head":[["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-ff58146f96da6d6b6775.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-745b6bc85baa9054ad74.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.b11cd6ab3c62dae3dfb8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/aa71f7ffe000c7e8f0c01f0f89601980827f7650.373afc1616d24ef66240.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/5a2cb1114c8504c89df33f5133e6592f3a100825.84f98f3312eda9faaace.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/90d169a9093741f51f34dc042505bf439fbe8e19.dc81bd0bac399cceeaa3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/71247caf95475e3ea7f9a0f8a30beb258b23d005.0b776a914d2341d7fbbb.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/f6078781a05fe1bcb0902d23dbbb2662c8d200b3.3f620dda7e662e91e325.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-ae3cb427ef9647681460.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/0c428ae2.8c5a600d061af116c63c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/9284526e3cdd06d16534c4e3aee9092e2395f424.ac5f8667495f82630f5d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/blog/post/%5Bslug%5D-4548e68514b6eceae971.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/U-O5WQXHlmPlqtRIwPfQt/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/U-O5WQXHlmPlqtRIwPfQt/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
