# Telegram Bot Usage

This is a reminder to myself and others who likes to recreate my
site.

Set **NTBA_FIX_319 = 1** environmental variable to disable any warning messages.

Set the **TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN** and **TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID_TARGET** environmental variable to 
enable sending messages to telegram from contact form.

Alternatively move the api to another repo to integrate with vercel maybe. Give
**CONTACT_API_URL**. Also make sure you have proper CORS headers.
