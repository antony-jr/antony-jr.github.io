---


QArchive is a cross-platform C++ library that modernizes libarchive , This library helps you to extract and compress 
archives supported by libarchive. The whole library itself is crafted to work perfectly well with the 
Qt event loop and thus its a perfect fit for your Qt projects.

I personally made this project to extract .7z archives in order to create a library that can update Qt Apps installed via
Qt Installer Framework without using the updater tool provided by Qt , because I hated using sub-process and besides
I wanted a in-built updater for my application and that's not possible with the already provided updater from 
Qt Installer Framework.

## Features

* *Single threaded and Non-Blocking API* - Using Qt's Event Loop. (**you can optionally run in a different thread**)

* *Easy to Use API* - Made some effort to match Qt's style.

* *Cyclic API , No use of mutex* - The whole library is fully cyclic and therefore no mutex is used.(Only signals and slots.)

* *Drink the Qt Kool-aid* - In a positive way.
