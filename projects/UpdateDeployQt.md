**updatedeployqt** is a command line tool which can **deploy** auto update feature or *integrate the updater into
your* QApplication with **zero code change.** This does **not depend** on the programming language you used to 
build the **Application** , *as long as it uses Qt framework , this feature can be deployed using this tool.*



**IMPORTANT**: *This software is in alpha stage.* **Remember with great power comes great responsibility.**


# Features

* *Deploy Native Auto Updater with* **zero code change** - *This done using Qt Plugin Injector*.

* **Programming Language Independent** - The reason you want to use this solution.

* *Supports AppImages , Qt Installer Framework and Applications released through Github.*

* *Light-weight* - Using this only takes about **800 KiB**.

* *Cross-platform* - Yet to implement but its going to be.

* *Respects General Data Protection Regulation* - unlike electron-updater.

* *Drink the Qt Kool-aid* - In a positive way.
