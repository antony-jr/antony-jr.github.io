Actually I do not wish to be \na one time contributor but a life long one. Just for the kicks.\n\nIn the last quater of 2020 I got myself involved with the **postmarketOS** folks who aim to mainline mobile phones so\n**the mainline kernel** can run on phones. \n\nYou see typically android phones use a very old linux kernel version which is heavily modified by the vendor.\nThis means you are at the mercy of your vendor and the moment the vendor stops software updates your phone can't\nget latest security fixes and new features. The only way to tackle this is to mainline everything the vendor did\nnot mainline. This means fixing the poor code they written and making them pass the reviews from the maintainer.\n\n**This is extreamly painful job. You have to port drivers and device tree for your phone.**\n\nI mainlined my old **ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser** phone which was stuck in Linux Kernel 3.10.x, Now it runs the latest mainline \nkernel, at the time of writing it is **5.11-rc4**.\n\nBut I have to say that the folks at **postmarketOS** really helped a lot. If you want to explore something amazing then\ntry mainlining your phone too. It's a very good experience.\n\nI sent the initial device tree for my device to maintainer of the Qualcomm groups tree of linux and it got accepted \nand was merged into the upstream after two weeks. I actually watered down a lot of story because I'm too lazy to write\nall of it. \n\n![Kernel Commit Log](/2020-12-27.png)\n\n\n**It's very exciting to see my name along with the great \"Linus Torvalds\", I just wish I can get to a position where I could \nargue with him someday.** ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n","slug":"2020-12-27","prevPost":{"title":"Securing my Cloud Instance with SSH Control","slugName":"2020-08-14","date":"Fri Aug 14 2020"},"nextPost":{"title":"FreeCAD the most unusual popular open source project in a \"Good Way\" ðŸ’–","slugName":"2021-01-24","date":"Sun Jan 24 2021"}},"__N_SSG":true}
