The $5 cloud instance has only *50 GB of Bandwidth*, Which isn't lot if you look at the bigger picture. Even the top end cloud instance has like 10 TB or so bandwidth. It's like having a big gun and\nnot knowing how to use it. **Vultr** is not that bad though, I would still recommend it to someone who is starting to learn how to use and manage\ncloud instances. \n\nWhen it comes to unlimited bandwidth, There are only handful of cloud instance providers, Which are small but somewhat trustable and good. But\nthey are slightly costly and overpowered for my use case. So my final choice was **Hetzner** after a lot of research.\n\n### A little background on Hetzner\n\n**Hetzner Online GmbH** is an Internet hosting company and data center operator based in Gunzenhausen, Germany(citing from wikipedia).\n\n**Hetzner** is a german company which is trusted by lot of developers in the open source community, Also they provide *20 TB Bandwidth for any cloud instance you buy from them*.\n\n\n### My First Attempt on Registering with Hetzner\n\nIn the first attempt they asked me a scan of my government identity. So I sent a photo of my government ID to them. They notified me that they\nwould call me back in 1-2 business days. I was really hoping to clear their security clearance but nope this is the email I get along with my\nHetzner account disabled forever.\n\n![Email Repy from Hetzner](/2020-08-10-hetzner-email.png)\n\n\n### My Second Attempt on Registereing with Hetzner\n\nWith respect to my first attempt, I sent a photo of my original government ID to hetzner verification email itself. But still no \nhope of enabling my account.\n\nSo I re-registered with Hetzner with my alternative email and this time without verification I got security clearance and I was greeted into\nmy cloud instances dashboard.\n\n**I really have no idea how they verified me when I used a different email address, but anyhow I was happy I'm finally registered with\nHetzner.**\n\n\n### Was it Worth it?\n\nIf I've gone with **Vultr** I would have got started in 10 minutes at maximum but with **Hetzner** I had to give my ID and wait for like a week \nto get a cloud instance. But I really think **Hetzner** was worth it. \n\nIf you are also verifying with **Hetzner**, I know it's frustrating but still **Hetzner** is the best cloud instance provider out there. But if\nyou really want to get your hands dirty, I recommend you to try out with **Vultr** for free.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHaving successfully registered with **Hetzner**, my current server which hosts this domain and other software made by me \ncost me about â‚¬2.34 which is way less than $5(exactly $2.75 at the time of writing). Also with that price I get a lot of bandwidth than \nwhat **Vultr** and **Digital Ocean** provides. I suppose **Hetzner** was worth the wait.\n \n","slug":"2020-08-10","prevPost":{"title":"Buying a Domain with Namecheap","slugName":"2020-08-08","date":"Sat Aug 08 2020"},"nextPost":{"title":"Securing my Cloud Instance with SSH Control","slugName":"2020-08-14","date":"Fri Aug 14 2020"}},"__N_SSG":true}
