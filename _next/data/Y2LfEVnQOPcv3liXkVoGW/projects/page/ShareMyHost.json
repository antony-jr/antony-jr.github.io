Primarily built to stream videos to Kodi or a Smart TV."},"markdownBody":"\n\n**ShareMyHost** is a simple and powerful program written in C++/QML using Google's material \ndesign guidelines. It gives a *very simple http server for sharing file(s) within your\nlocal network*. It uses **mount points** which are sort of like http endpoints with directory\nlisting to specific directories in your file system.\n\nFor example, You create a **Mount Point**(say /Animes to /home/user/Anime) then you can access\nthe directory listing and all its files at ```http://ip:port/Animes``` (Ex: http://192.168.1.3:8080/Animes).\n\n\n[Get Binaries from Releases](https://github.com/antony-jr/ShareMyHost/releases)\n\n\n## Features\n\n\n* *Easy to Use* - This program is specifically built for ease of use.\n\n* *Support for Kodi HTTP Client* - The best of my knowledge, this is the only application which supports listing of files in kodi \n  from the mount points.\n\n* *Directory Listing by Default* - No need to fight with permissions in linux.\n\n* *Automatic Permission Managemnt* - No need to worry about who owns what.\n\n* *Mongoose Server as Backend* - Uses a trusted Web Server.\n\n* *Material Design* - Built using QML with Material Style.\n\n\n# Support \n\nIf you think that this project is **cool** then you can give it a :star: or :fork_and_knife: it if you want to improve it with me. I really :heart: stars though!   \n\nYou can also tweet about me on twitter , get connected with me [@antonyjr0](https://twitter.com/antonyjr0)\n\nThank You! :smiley_cat:\n\n# Icons\n\nAll icons used in this program has been made by [Icons8](https://icons8.com). \n\n# Mongoose Server Usage\n\nThis program uses the mongoose server for serving contents, Since it's in GPLV2 this program is also under \nGPLV2 to comply with the license. \n\nThe source of mongoose server has been heavily modified to our specific use case, such as the usage with\nmount points. Therefore for updating the mongoose server code, we must be careful not to remove the \nmodified code. *All modification to the code is mentioned in the top of source files.*\n\n\n# License\n\nThe GNU General Public License V2.\n\nCopyright (C) Antony Jr.\n\n","slug":"ShareMyHost"},"__N_SSG":true}
