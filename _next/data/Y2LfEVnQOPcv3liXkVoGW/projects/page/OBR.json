Can be integrated with Machine Learning"},"markdownBody":"\n\n**Optical braille recognition** is the act of capturing and processing images of braille characters into natural language characters. It is used to convert braille documents for people who cannot read them into text, and for preservation and reproduction of the documents. \n\nThe recognition uses simple computational geometry to do the segmentation and classification.\nOptionally you can use the segmenting engine and use your own classifier, a artificial neural network might be a good choice.\n\nBut it is worth to note that the segmenting engine only works with single sided English braille.\n\n*Documentation is not given because I think no one will need this, atleast for now.\nIf you want a Documentation, please raise an issue.*\n\n# Try it\n\nPlease visit [this](https://opticalbraillerecognition-demo.herokuapp.com) heroku application to see the demo.\n\n# License\n\nThe BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License.\n\nCopyright (C) 2020, Antony jr.   \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n","slug":"OBR"},"__N_SSG":true}
