This project may even be **deleted** without any notice. -- Antony Jr.\n\n\n**updatedeployqt** is a command line tool which can **deploy** auto update feature or *integrate the updater into\nyour* QApplication with **zero code change.** This does **not depend** on the programming language you used to \nbuild the **Application** , *as long as it uses Qt framework , this feature can be deployed using this tool.*\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: *This software is in alpha stage.* **Remember with great power comes great responsibility.**\n\n\n# Features\n\n* *Deploy Native Auto Updater with* **zero code change** - *This done using Qt Plugin Injector*.\n\n* **Programming Language Independent** - The reason you want to use this solution.\n\n* *Supports AppImages , Qt Installer Framework and Applications released through Github.*\n\n* *Light-weight* - Using this only takes about **800 KiB**.\n\n* *Cross-platform* - Yet to implement but its going to be.\n\n* *Respects General Data Protection Regulation* - unlike electron-updater.\n\n* *Drink the Qt Kool-aid* - In a positive way.\n\n\n# Installation\n\n### Linux \n\nYou don't need to compile this from source , simply download the latest AppImage from releases and make it\nexecutable and you are ready to go. This works in travis-ci and other such services too. So you can deploy\nupdate directly on continuous integration services.\n\nYou can download the latest AppImage from this [url](https://github.com/antony-jr/updatedeployqt/releases/download/continuous/updatedeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage). This *url* will be constant and will never change and thus\nyou can use this *url* to download the AppImage using wget whenever you want to use it.\n\n```\n $ wget -O updatedeployqt-x86_64.AppImage \"https://git.io/fj4CH\"\n $ chmod +x updatedeployqt-x86_64.AppImage\n $ ./updatedeployqt-x86_64.AppImage\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nNot yet implemented\n\n### MacOSX\n\nNot yet implemented\n\n\n# Usage\n\nThe program looks for **updatedeployqt.json** in the current working directory or in the path \ngiven through ```-c,--config``` argument. This configuration file can be interactively generated\nby passing ```-g,--generate-config``` argument to the program.\n\nThis configuration file will decide on how the updater should work , such as auto update without\nthe users concern or integrate the updater into a menu bar item.\n\nAfter generating the configuration file , you can simply run the below command to deploy your \nupdater.\n\n\n```\n $ updatedeployqt [PATH TO DEPLOY DIRECTORY]\n```\n\nor if **updatedeployqt.json** is not in the current working directory.\n\n```\n $ updatedeployqt -c[PATH TO CONFIG FILE] [PATH TO DEPLOY DIRECTORY]\n```\n\n\nThe **deploy directory** is a directory which you have finalized and packaged all required libraries \nand plugins along with your executable and resources. In case you are packaging **AppImages** then \nthe **deploy directory** is your **AppDir**. \n\n\n# Projects Using This\n\nFeel free to open a **PR** to include your project too. Here are some known projects which use this to deploy\nauto update feature for their Qt application.\n\n* [Blue Glow](https://github.com/antony-jr/blue-glow) - You can use this as an example.\n\n* [QTalarm-AppImage](https://github.com/antony-jr/QTalarm-AppImage) - You can also use this as an example.\n\n\n\n# License\n\nBSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019, Antony Jr.   \n\n\n\n","slug":"UpdateDeployQt"},"__N_SSG":true}
