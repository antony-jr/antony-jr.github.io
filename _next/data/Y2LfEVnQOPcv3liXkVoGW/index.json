Simply extracts 7z hamburger, Tarballs ðŸŽ± and other supported formats by libarchive. ðŸ’–"},"markdownBody":"\n\nQArchive is a cross-platform C++ library that modernizes libarchive , This library helps you to extract and compress \narchives supported by libarchive. The whole library itself is crafted to work perfectly well with the \nQt event loop and thus its a perfect fit for your Qt projects.\n\nI personally made this project to extract .7z archives in order to create a library that can update Qt Apps installed via\nQt Installer Framework without using the updater tool provided by Qt , because I hated using sub-process and besides\nI wanted a in-built updater for my application and that's not possible with the already provided updater from \nQt Installer Framework.\n\n## Features\n\n* *Single threaded and Non-Blocking API* - Using Qt's Event Loop. (**you can optionally run in a different thread**)\n\n* *Easy to Use API* - Made some effort to match Qt's style.\n\n* *Cyclic API , No use of mutex* - The whole library is fully cyclic and therefore no mutex is used.(Only signals and slots.)\n\n* *Drink the Qt Kool-aid* - In a positive way.\n\n\n**Witness it with your own eyes,**\n\n```cpp\n#include <QCoreApplication>\n#include <QArchive/QArchive>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    using QArchive::DiskExtractor;\n    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);\n    DiskExtractor Extractor(\"Test.7z\");\n    \n    /* Connect Signals and Slots. */\n    QObject::connect(&Extractor , \n                     &DiskExtractor::finished , \n                     &app , \n                     &QCoreApplication::quit);\n    \n    Extractor.start();\n    return app.exec();\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# Getting Started\n\nLearn more about **QArchive** at the official [documentation](https://antony-jr.github.io/QArchive).\n\n\n## Conan\n\n*Thanks to [Eric Riff](https://github.com/ericriff)*.\n\nStarting from version 2.0.1 `QArchive` is available on the [Conan C/C++ package manager](https://conan.io/), which means you can download prebuilt packages for all major platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc).\n\nFind an example on how to consume Conan's precompiled packages in the examples folder.\n\n\n# Thank You ![Thank You](https://img.shields.io/badge/Always-Say%20Thank%20You!-blue.svg?style=flat-square)\n\nI really need to thank the developers of these libraries for creating it because QArchive is elegant because of them! :heart:   \n\n* [libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive)\n* [Qt](https://github.com/qt)\n\n\n\n# Support\n\nIf you think that this project is **cool** then you can give it a :star: or :fork_and_knife: it if you want to improve it with me. I really :heart: stars though!   \n\n\n# License\n\nThe BSD 3-clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License.\n\nCopyright (C) 2017-present, QArchive Contributors and Antony J.R\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n","slug":"QArchive"},"posts":{"slice1":[{"author":"Antony Jr.","title":"FreeCAD the most unusual popular open source project in a \"Good Way\" ðŸ’–","description":"If you had worked with any popular open source project, you may know that they are very picky.
