This project may even be **deleted** without any notice. -- Antony Jr.\n\n\n**updatedeployqt** is a command line tool which can **deploy** auto update feature or *integrate the updater into\nyour* QApplication with **zero code change.** This does **not depend** on the programming language you used to \nbuild the **Application** , *as long as it uses Qt framework , this feature can be deployed using this tool.*\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: *This software is in alpha stage.* **Remember with great power comes great responsibility.**\n\n\n# Features\n\n* *Deploy Native Auto Updater with* **zero code change** - *This done using Qt Plugin Injector*.\n\n* **Programming Language Independent** - The reason you want to use this solution.\n\n* *Supports AppImages , Qt Installer Framework and Applications released through Github.*\n\n* *Light-weight* - Using this only takes about **800 KiB**.\n\n* *Cross-platform* - Yet to implement but its going to be.\n\n* *Respects General Data Protection Regulation* - unlike electron-updater.\n\n* *Drink the Qt Kool-aid* - In a positive way.\n\n# Projects Using This\n\nFeel free to open a **PR** to include your project too. Here are some known projects which use this to deploy\nauto update feature for their Qt application.\n\n* [Blue Glow](https://github.com/antony-jr/blue-glow) - You can use this as an example.\n\n* [QTalarm-AppImage](https://github.com/antony-jr/QTalarm-AppImage) - You can also use this as an example.\n\n\n\n# License\n\nBSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2019, Antony Jr.   \n\n\n\n","slug":"UpdateDeployQt"},"__N_SSG":true}
