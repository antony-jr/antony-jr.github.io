Red Hat has generously **donated** Insight to the **public** and even pays a few people to work on it occasionally.\n\nBut one problem exists , Insight is hard to get **now** and a lot of people might want it because **Jeff** exclusively uses it in his\n**book** namely **'Assembly Language Step by Step Programming with Linux'** and so did I , Therefore I built an **appimage** for insight and so other folks who stumbles upon the same problem don't have to wreck their head on compiling insight from source.\nInfact you **don't even have to install anything** , **Just download a binary and mark it executable**.\n\nDownload the **binary** and **mark it executable** as mentioned in the **table below** , This **does not depend on anything**\nthis can even run in a live boot **without installing anything**, Have fun!\n\n[Get Binaries from Releases](https://github.com/antony-jr/insight/releases/)\n\n\n**Important note:** Please use **absolute paths** when using command line arguments like ``` -q ./YourApp ```.   \n\nIf you want support for **32 bits** then rise a issue because nowadays modern pc's are not **32 bits** but **Jeff Duntemann's** book is dealing with **IA-32** where this tool is required , Irony!\n\n\n# Upstream Repo\n\nThanks to **redhat**, Insight's git repo is still kept alive at ```git://sourceware.org/git/insight.git```.   \nBut be **warned that building it from source is very challenging when its done in a modern os** and also requires you \nto provide **Tcl/Tk** libraries externally. *I bet you will be satisfied with the portable binary*.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThis portable package is only possible because of these projects , do check them out.\n\n* **[Assembly Step by Step](https://www.amazon.com/Assembly-Language-Step-Step-Programming/dp/0470497025)** - Inspiration to make this project.\n* **[AppImage](https://github.com/appimage/)** - Used to package the portable binary.\n* **[Insight/RedHat](https://sourceware.org/insight/)** - Thanks to RedHat for keeping this alive to this date.\n\n# License\n\nOnly the **patches** and **build scripts** are under , **The MIT License.**   \nCopyright (C) 2018 Antony Jr.\n\n","slug":"Insight"},"__N_SSG":true}
