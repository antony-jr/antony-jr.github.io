(does not require any other permissions)\n\n[Get Binaries from Releases](https://github.com/antony-jr/blue-glow/releases)\n\n\n# Other Platform Support\n\nI don't really think that anyone would use this, I mainly created this for myself. So if you need this application for other platforms other than linux, Then I would be happy to activate automatic builds for Windows and MacOSX.\n(PS: The application is mostly cross platform)\n\n# Artwork\n\nAll graphics work by [Atra](https://github.com/estatra).\n\nThe graphics work uses a modified version of bell icon from [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) which is licensed under MIT.\n\nFont used in the graphic work is [Source Serif Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro) and it is licensed under Open Font License.\n\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License.   \nCopyright (C) 2020, [@antony-jr](https://github.com/antony-jr).\n\n","slug":"BlueGlow"},"__N_SSG":true}
