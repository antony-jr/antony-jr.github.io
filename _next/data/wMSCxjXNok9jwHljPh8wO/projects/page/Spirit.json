Please try out the app.","description":"The Twenty First Century Window Sitter. ðŸ’–"},"markdownBody":"\nSpirit is a modern and hackable desktop mascot, it operates very similar to **MaCoPix** and \n**Shimeji** but was never invented to replace either of them. Spirit is made just out of \ncuriousity and as an alternative to both of them since both are legacy software.\n\nSpirit is built from the ground up using Qt5 Framework and C++, uses rust for it's auxilary tools \nand helper applications. Spirit is also cross-platform and can run in all the major platforms \nwith no issues.\n\n[Ritual](https://github.com/antony-jr/ritual) is used to create new spirits, but you can download\nofficial spirits from [here](https://antonyjr.in/spirit/docs/spirit-files/download).\nYou can also use [Spirit addons](https://antonyjr.in/spirit/docs/programs) which are simple \nprograms which interacts with Spirit using it's REST API to do some meaningful things like \nnotifying when a command fails.\n\n**Wayland support is on the way but not anytime soon, sorry, please see why this is the case\nin this small [blog post](https://antonyjr.in/spirit/blog/wayland)**.\n\n# Installation\n\nDownload the software for your platform from [official website](https://antonyjr.in/spirit/). And\nfollow through the instructions. It's really simple, unlike **Shimeji** which involves installing\na legacy version of JRE.\n\nFor more information, please head over to the [official website](https://antonyjr.in/spirit/).\n\n# License\n\nThe GNU General Public License v3.\n\nCopyright (C) 2021-present, D.
