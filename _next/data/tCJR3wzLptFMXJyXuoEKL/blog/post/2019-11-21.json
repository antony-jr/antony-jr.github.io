At my home my main computer and my Smart TV\nbuilt using a *Raspberry Pi* is connected to my broadband network. So everything at my home is connected by LAN.\n\nI used to use **http-server**(node module) to stream movies from my computer to my Smart TV but it was kind of hard to use and \nwas not made for streaming movies. Also I had to frequently change directories and to change to different location to stream different \ncontent to my Smart TV.\n\nSo I looked for some solution for this problem. What I wanted was a software which could create HTTP endpoints to specific locations \non my computer.\n\nSurprisingly there was no software that follows my description.\n\nI'm Software Engineer so I built the software I needed. Simple as that. It is worthy to note that I'm not a professional software engineer.\n\n\nI used Mongose server and embeded it into my Qt/QML application **ShareMyHost**. I modified the mongose server source code to use \nhttp mountpoints.\n\nYou can checkout the project at https://github.com/antony-jr/ShareMyHost, If you want to support it please star it.\n\n","slug":"2019-11-21","prevPost":{"title":"Update Deploy Qt: Making updaters for Qt Application with a single command","slugName":"2019-08-19","date":"Mon Aug 19 2019"},"nextPost":{"title":"Buying a Domain with Namecheap","slugName":"2020-08-08","date":"Sat Aug 08 2020"}},"__N_SSG":true}
