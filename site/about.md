I build clean C/C++ application and libraries both high and low level.
I know a lot of programming languages but C++ is my Jam (*I'm starting to love rust more than C++ nowadays*).
My primary interest lies in **Theoretical Computer Science** and **Artificial General Intelligence**.
Even though I like programming and open source work, My life long quest will always be research
and implementing my research.
