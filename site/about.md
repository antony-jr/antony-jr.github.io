subtitle: "I'm an **Open Source Developer** and **Aspiring Computer Scientist**."

I build clean C/C++ application and libraries both high and low level.
I know a lot of programming languages but C++ is my Jam.
My primary interest lies in **Theoretical Computer Science** and **Artificial General Intelligence**.
Even though I like programming and open source work, My life long quest will always be research
and implementing my research. 

I will not work in the Software Industry in the foreseeable future because I think all they do is 
suck people's life away. But I do respect companies who respect their employee.

Some private software company that I like are Google, Facebook and Microsoft because of their donations
and contributions to open source projects. But my love for those company are in a grey area.

I love to watch Animes all day.
